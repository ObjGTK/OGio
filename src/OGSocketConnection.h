/**
 * `GSocketConnection` is a [class@Gio.IOStream] for a connected socket. They
 * can be created either by [class@Gio.SocketClient] when connecting to a host,
 * or by [class@Gio.SocketListener] when accepting a new client.
 * 
 * The type of the `GSocketConnection` object returned from these calls
 * depends on the type of the underlying socket that is in use. For
 * instance, for a TCP/IP connection it will be a [class@Gio.TcpConnection].
 * 
 * Choosing what type of object to construct is done with the socket
 * connection factory, and it is possible for third parties to register
 * custom socket connection types for specific combination of socket
 * family/type/protocol using [func@Gio.SocketConnection.factory_register_type].
 * 
 * To close a `GSocketConnection`, use [method@Gio.IOStream.close]. Closing both
 * substreams of the [class@Gio.IOStream] separately will not close the
 * underlying [class@Gio.Socket].
