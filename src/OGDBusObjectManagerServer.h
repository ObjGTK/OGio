/**
 * `GDBusObjectManagerServer` is used to export [iface@Gio.DBusObject] instances
 * using the standardized
 * [`org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager`](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-objectmanager)
 * interface. For example, remote D-Bus clients can get all objects
 * and properties in a single call. Additionally, any change in the
 * object hierarchy is broadcast using signals. This means that D-Bus
 * clients can keep caches up to date by only listening to D-Bus
 * signals.
 * 
 * The recommended path to export an object manager at is the path form of the
 * well-known name of a D-Bus service, or below. For example, if a D-Bus service
 * is available at the well-known name `net.example.ExampleService1`, the object
 * manager should typically be exported at `/net/example/ExampleService1`, or
 * below (to allow for multiple object managers in a service).
 * 
 * It is supported, but not recommended, to export an object manager at the root
 * path, `/`.
 * 
 * See [class@Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient] for the client-side code that is
 * intended to be used with `GDBusObjectManagerServer` or any D-Bus
 * object implementing the `org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager` interface.
