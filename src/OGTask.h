/**
 * A `GTask` represents and manages a cancellable ‘task’.
 * 
 * ## Asynchronous operations
 * 
 * The most common usage of `GTask` is as a [iface@Gio.AsyncResult], to
 * manage data during an asynchronous operation. You call
 * [ctor@Gio.Task.new] in the ‘start’ method, followed by
 * [method@Gio.Task.set_task_data] and the like if you need to keep some
 * additional data associated with the task, and then pass the
 * task object around through your asynchronous operation.
 * Eventually, you will call a method such as
 * [method@Gio.Task.return_pointer] or [method@Gio.Task.return_error], which
 * will save the value you give it and then invoke the task’s callback
 * function in the thread-default main context (see
 * [method@GLib.MainContext.push_thread_default])
 * where it was created (waiting until the next iteration of the main
 * loop first, if necessary). The caller will pass the `GTask` back to
 * the operation’s finish function (as a [iface@Gio.AsyncResult]), and you can
 * use [method@Gio.Task.propagate_pointer] or the like to extract the
 * return value.
 * 
 * Using `GTask` requires the thread-default [struct@GLib.MainContext] from when
 * the `GTask` was constructed to be running at least until the task has
 * completed and its data has been freed.
 * 
 * If a `GTask` has been constructed and its callback set, it is an error to
 * not call `g_task_return_*()` on it. GLib will warn at runtime if this happens
 * (since 2.76).
 * 
 * Here is an example for using `GTask` as a [iface@Gio.AsyncResult]:
 * ```c
 * typedef struct {
 *   CakeFrostingType frosting;
 *   char *message;
 * } DecorationData;
 * 
 * static void
 * decoration_data_free (DecorationData *decoration)
 * {
 *   g_free (decoration->message);
 *   g_slice_free (DecorationData, decoration);
 * }
 * 
 * static void
 * baked_cb (Cake     *cake,
 *           gpointer  user_data)
 * {
 *   GTask *task = user_data;
 *   DecorationData *decoration = g_task_get_task_data (task);
 *   GError *error = NULL;
 * 
 *   if (cake == NULL)
 *     {
 *       g_task_return_new_error (task, BAKER_ERROR, BAKER_ERROR_NO_FLOUR,
 *                                "Go to the supermarket");
 *       g_object_unref (task);
 *       return;
 *     }
 * 
 *   if (!cake_decorate (cake, decoration->frosting, decoration->message, &error))
 *     {
 *       g_object_unref (cake);
 *       // g_task_return_error() takes ownership of error
 *       g_task_return_error (task, error);
 *       g_object_unref (task);
 *       return;
 *     }
 * 
 *   g_task_return_pointer (task, cake, g_object_unref);
 *   g_object_unref (task);
 * }
 * 
 * void
 * baker_bake_cake_async (Baker               *self,
 *                        guint                radius,
 *                        CakeFlavor           flavor,
 *                        CakeFrostingType     frosting,
 *                        const char          *message,
 *                        GCancellable        *cancellable,
 *                        GAsyncReadyCallback  callback,
 *                        gpointer             user_data)
 * {
 *   GTask *task;
 *   DecorationData *decoration;
 *   Cake  *cake;
 * 
 *   task = g_task_new (self, cancellable, callback, user_data);
 *   if (radius < 3)
 *     {
 *       g_task_return_new_error (task, BAKER_ERROR, BAKER_ERROR_TOO_SMALL,
 *                                "%ucm radius cakes are silly",
 *                                radius);
 *       g_object_unref (task);
 *       return;
 *     }
 * 
 *   cake = _baker_get_cached_cake (self, radius, flavor, frosting, message);
 *   if (cake != NULL)
 *     {
 *       // _baker_get_cached_cake() returns a reffed cake
 *       g_task_return_pointer (task, cake, g_object_unref);
 *       g_object_unref (task);
 *       return;
 *     }
 * 
 *   decoration = g_slice_new (DecorationData);
 *   decoration->frosting = frosting;
 *   decoration->message = g_strdup (message);
 *   g_task_set_task_data (task, decoration, (GDestroyNotify) decoration_data_free);
 * 
 *   _baker_begin_cake (self, radius, flavor, cancellable, baked_cb, task);
 * }
 * 
 * Cake *
 * baker_bake_cake_finish (Baker         *self,
 *                         GAsyncResult  *result,

 * {
 *   g_return_val_if_fail (g_task_is_valid (result, self), NULL);
 * 
 *   return g_task_propagate_pointer (G_TASK (result), error);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Chained asynchronous operations
 * 
 * `GTask` also tries to simplify asynchronous operations that
 * internally chain together several smaller asynchronous
 * operations. [method@Gio.Task.get_cancellable], [method@Gio.Task.get_context],
 * and [method@Gio.Task.get_priority] allow you to get back the task’s
 * [class@Gio.Cancellable], [struct@GLib.MainContext], and
 * [I/O priority](iface.AsyncResult.html#io-priority)
 * when starting a new subtask, so you don’t have to keep track
 * of them yourself. [method@Gio.Task.attach_source] simplifies the case
 * of waiting for a source to fire (automatically using the correct
 * [struct@GLib.MainContext] and priority).
 * 
 * Here is an example for chained asynchronous operations:
 * ```c
 * typedef struct {
 *   Cake *cake;
 *   CakeFrostingType frosting;
 *   char *message;
 * } BakingData;
 * 
 * static void
 * decoration_data_free (BakingData *bd)
 * {
 *   if (bd->cake)
 *     g_object_unref (bd->cake);
 *   g_free (bd->message);
 *   g_slice_free (BakingData, bd);
 * }
 * 
 * static void
 * decorated_cb (Cake         *cake,
 *               GAsyncResult *result,
 *               gpointer      user_data)
 * {
 *   GTask *task = user_data;
 *   GError *error = NULL;
 * 
 *   if (!cake_decorate_finish (cake, result, &error))
 *     {
 *       g_object_unref (cake);
 *       g_task_return_error (task, error);
 *       g_object_unref (task);
 *       return;
 *     }
 * 
 *   // baking_data_free() will drop its ref on the cake, so we have to
 *   // take another here to give to the caller.

 *   g_object_unref (task);
 * }

 *       g_object_unref (task);
 *       return;
 *     }
 * 
 *   bd->cake = cake;
 * 
 *   // Bail out now if the user has already cancelled
 *   if (g_task_return_error_if_cancelled (task))
 *     {
 *       g_object_unref (task);
 *       return;
 *     }
 * 
 *   if (cake_decorator_available (cake))
 *     decorator_ready (task);
 *   else

 *       // Attach @source to @task’s GMainContext and have it call
 *       // decorator_ready() when it is ready.

 *       g_source_unref (source);
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * void
 * baker_bake_cake_async (Baker               *self,
 *                        guint                radius,

 * ```
 * 
 * ## Asynchronous operations from synchronous ones
 * 
 * You can use [method@Gio.Task.run_in_thread] to turn a synchronous
 * operation into an asynchronous one, by running it in a thread.
 * When it completes, the result will be dispatched to the thread-default main
 * context (see [method@GLib.MainContext.push_thread_default]) where the `GTask`
 * was created.
 * 
 * Running a task in a thread:
 * ```c
 * typedef struct {
 *   guint radius;
 *   CakeFlavor flavor;
 *   CakeFrostingType frosting;
 *   char *message;
 * } CakeData;
 * 
 * static void
 * cake_data_free (CakeData *cake_data)
 * {
 *   g_free (cake_data->message);
 *   g_slice_free (CakeData, cake_data);
 * }
 * 
 * static void
 * bake_cake_thread (GTask         *task,
 *                   gpointer       source_object,
 *                   gpointer       task_data,
 *                   GCancellable  *cancellable)
 * {
 *   Baker *self = source_object;
 *   CakeData *cake_data = task_data;
 *   Cake *cake;
 *   GError *error = NULL;
 * 
 *   cake = bake_cake (baker, cake_data->radius, cake_data->flavor,
 *                     cake_data->frosting, cake_data->message,
 *                     cancellable, &error);
 *   if (cake)
 *     g_task_return_pointer (task, cake, g_object_unref);
 *   else
 *     g_task_return_error (task, error);
 * }
 * 
 * void
 * baker_bake_cake_async (Baker               *self,
 *                        guint                radius,
 *                        CakeFlavor           flavor,
 *                        CakeFrostingType     frosting,
 *                        const char          *message,
 *                        GCancellable        *cancellable,
 *                        GAsyncReadyCallback  callback,
 *                        gpointer             user_data)
 * {
 *   CakeData *cake_data;
 *   GTask *task;
 * 
 *   cake_data = g_slice_new (CakeData);
 *   cake_data->radius = radius;
 *   cake_data->flavor = flavor;
 *   cake_data->frosting = frosting;
 *   cake_data->message = g_strdup (message);
 *   task = g_task_new (self, cancellable, callback, user_data);
 *   g_task_set_task_data (task, cake_data, (GDestroyNotify) cake_data_free);
 *   g_task_run_in_thread (task, bake_cake_thread);
 *   g_object_unref (task);
 * }
 * 
 * Cake *
 * baker_bake_cake_finish (Baker         *self,
 *                         GAsyncResult  *result,
 *                         GError       **error)
 * {
 *   g_return_val_if_fail (g_task_is_valid (result, self), NULL);
 * 
 *   return g_task_propagate_pointer (G_TASK (result), error);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Adding cancellability to uncancellable tasks
 * 
 * Finally, [method@Gio.Task.run_in_thread] and
 * [method@Gio.Task.run_in_thread_sync] can be used to turn an uncancellable
 * operation into a cancellable one. If you call
 * [method@Gio.Task.set_return_on_cancel], passing `TRUE`, then if the task’s
 * [class@Gio.Cancellable] is cancelled, it will return control back to the
 * caller immediately, while allowing the task thread to continue running in the
 * background (and simply discarding its result when it finally does finish).
 * Provided that the task thread is careful about how it uses
 * locks and other externally-visible resources, this allows you
 * to make ‘GLib-friendly’ asynchronous and cancellable
 * synchronous variants of blocking APIs.
 * 
 * Cancelling a task:
 * ```c
 * static void
 * bake_cake_thread (GTask         *task,
 *                   gpointer       source_object,
 *                   gpointer       task_data,
 *                   GCancellable  *cancellable)
 * {
 *   Baker *self = source_object;
 *   CakeData *cake_data = task_data;
 *   Cake *cake;
 *   GError *error = NULL;
 * 
 *   cake = bake_cake (baker, cake_data->radius, cake_data->flavor,
 *                     cake_data->frosting, cake_data->message,
 *                     &error);
 *   if (error)
 *     {
 *       g_task_return_error (task, error);
 *       return;
 *     }
 * 
 *   // If the task has already been cancelled, then we don’t want to add
 *   // the cake to the cake cache. Likewise, we don’t  want to have the
 *   // task get cancelled in the middle of updating the cache.
 *   // g_task_set_return_on_cancel() will return %TRUE here if it managed
 *   // to disable return-on-cancel, or %FALSE if the task was cancelled
 *   // before it could.
 *   if (g_task_set_return_on_cancel (task, FALSE))
 *     {
 *       // If the caller cancels at this point, their
 *       // GAsyncReadyCallback won’t be invoked until we return,
 *       // so we don’t have to worry that this code will run at
 *       // the same time as that code does. But if there were
 *       // other functions that might look at the cake cache,
 *       // then we’d probably need a GMutex here as well.

 * 
 * ## Porting from [class@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult]
 * 
 * `GTask`’s API attempts to be simpler than [class@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult]’s
 * in several ways:
 * 
 * - You can save task-specific data with [method@Gio.Task.set_task_data], and
 *   retrieve it later with [method@Gio.Task.get_task_data]. This replaces the
 *   abuse of [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.set_op_res_gpointer] for the same
 *   purpose with [class@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult].
 * - In addition to the task data, `GTask` also keeps track of the
 *   [priority](iface.AsyncResult.html#io-priority), [class@Gio.Cancellable],
 *   and [struct@GLib.MainContext] associated with the task, so tasks that
 *   consist of a chain of simpler asynchronous operations will have easy access
 *   to those values when starting each sub-task.
 * - [method@Gio.Task.return_error_if_cancelled] provides simplified
 *   handling for cancellation. In addition, cancellation
 *   overrides any other `GTask` return value by default, like
 *   [class@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult] does when
 *   [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.set_check_cancellable] is called.
 *   (You can use [method@Gio.Task.set_check_cancellable] to turn off that
 *   behavior.) On the other hand, [method@Gio.Task.run_in_thread]
 *   guarantees that it will always run your
 *   `task_func`, even if the task’s [class@Gio.Cancellable]
 *   is already cancelled before the task gets a chance to run;
 *   you can start your `task_func` with a
 *   [method@Gio.Task.return_error_if_cancelled] check if you need the
 *   old behavior.
 * - The ‘return’ methods (eg, [method@Gio.Task.return_pointer])
 *   automatically cause the task to be ‘completed’ as well, and
 *   there is no need to worry about the ‘complete’ vs ‘complete in idle’
 *   distinction. (`GTask` automatically figures out
 *   whether the task’s callback can be invoked directly, or
 *   if it needs to be sent to another [struct@GLib.MainContext], or delayed
 *   until the next iteration of the current [struct@GLib.MainContext].)
 * - The ‘finish’ functions for `GTask` based operations are generally
 *   much simpler than [class@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult] ones, normally consisting
 *   of only a single call to [method@Gio.Task.propagate_pointer] or the like.
 *   Since [method@Gio.Task.propagate_pointer] ‘steals’ the return value from
 *   the `GTask`, it is not necessary to juggle pointers around to
 *   prevent it from being freed twice.
 * - With [class@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult], it was common to call
 *   [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.propagate_error] from the
 *   `_finish()` wrapper function, and have
 *   virtual method implementations only deal with successful
 *   returns. This behavior is deprecated, because it makes it
 *   difficult for a subclass to chain to a parent class’s async
 *   methods. Instead, the wrapper function should just be a
 *   simple wrapper, and the virtual method should call an
 *   appropriate `g_task_propagate_` function.
 *   Note that wrapper methods can now use
 *   [method@Gio.AsyncResult.legacy_propagate_error] to do old-style
 *   [class@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult] error-returning behavior, and
 *   [method@Gio.AsyncResult.is_tagged] to check if a result is tagged as
 *   having come from the `_async()` wrapper
 *   function (for ‘short-circuit’ results, such as when passing
 *   `0` to [method@Gio.InputStream.read_async]).
 * 
 * ## Thread-safety considerations
 * 
 * Due to some infelicities in the API design, there is a
 * thread-safety concern that users of `GTask` have to be aware of:
 * 
 * If the `main` thread drops its last reference to the source object
 * or the task data before the task is finalized, then the finalizers
 * of these objects may be called on the worker thread.
 * 
 * This is a problem if the finalizers use non-threadsafe API, and
 * can lead to hard-to-debug crashes. Possible workarounds include:
 * 
 * - Clear task data in a signal handler for `notify::completed`
 * - Keep iterating a main context in the main thread and defer
 *   dropping the reference to the source object to that main
 *   context when the task is finalized
