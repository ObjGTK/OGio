/**
 * The object that handles DNS resolution. Use [func@Gio.Resolver.get_default]
 * to get the default resolver.
 * 
 * `GResolver` provides cancellable synchronous and asynchronous DNS
 * resolution, for hostnames ([method@Gio.Resolver.lookup_by_address],
 * [method@Gio.Resolver.lookup_by_name] and their async variants) and SRV
 * (service) records ([method@Gio.Resolver.lookup_service]).
 * 
 * [class@Gio.NetworkAddress] and [class@Gio.NetworkService] provide wrappers
 * around `GResolver` functionality that also implement
 * [iface@Gio.SocketConnectable], making it easy to connect to a remote
 * host/service.
 * 
 * The default resolver (see [func@Gio.Resolver.get_default]) has a timeout of
 * 30s set on it since GLib 2.78. Earlier versions of GLib did not support
 * resolver timeouts.
 * 
 * This is an abstract type; subclasses of it implement different resolvers for
 * different platforms and situations.
