/**
 * The `GCredentials` type is a reference-counted wrapper for native
 * credentials.
 * 
 * The information in `GCredentials` is typically used for identifying,
 * authenticating and authorizing other processes.
 * 
 * Some operating systems supports looking up the credentials of the remote
 * peer of a communication endpoint - see e.g. [method@Gio.Socket.get_credentials].
 * 
 * Some operating systems supports securely sending and receiving
 * credentials over a Unix Domain Socket, see [class@Gio.UnixCredentialsMessage],
 * [method@Gio.UnixConnection.send_credentials] and
 * [method@Gio.UnixConnection.receive_credentials] for details.
 * 
 * On Linux, the native credential type is a `struct ucred` - see the
 * [`unix(7)` man page](man:unix(7)) for details. This corresponds to
 * `G_CREDENTIALS_TYPE_LINUX_UCRED`.
 * 
 * On Apple operating systems (including iOS, tvOS, and macOS), the native credential
 * type is a `struct xucred`. This corresponds to `G_CREDENTIALS_TYPE_APPLE_XUCRED`.
 * 
 * On FreeBSD, Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd, the native credential type is a
 * `struct cmsgcred`. This corresponds to `G_CREDENTIALS_TYPE_FREEBSD_CMSGCRED`.
 * 
 * On NetBSD, the native credential type is a `struct unpcbid`.
 * This corresponds to `G_CREDENTIALS_TYPE_NETBSD_UNPCBID`.
 * 
 * On OpenBSD, the native credential type is a `struct sockpeercred`.
 * This corresponds to `G_CREDENTIALS_TYPE_OPENBSD_SOCKPEERCRED`.
 * 
 * On Solaris (including OpenSolaris and its derivatives), the native credential type
 * is a `ucred_t`. This corresponds to `G_CREDENTIALS_TYPE_SOLARIS_UCRED`.
 * 
 * Since GLib 2.72, on Windows, the native credentials may contain the PID of a
 * process. This corresponds to `G_CREDENTIALS_TYPE_WIN32_PID`.
