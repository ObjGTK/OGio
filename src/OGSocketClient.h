 * `GSocketClient` is a lightweight high-level utility class for connecting to

 * 
 * You create a `GSocketClient` object, set any options you want, and then
 * call a sync or async connect operation, which returns a
 * [class@Gio.SocketConnection] subclass on success.
 * 
 * The type of the [class@Gio.SocketConnection] object returned depends on the
 * type of the underlying socket that is in use. For instance, for a TCP/IP
 * connection it will be a [class@Gio.TcpConnection].
 * 
 * As `GSocketClient` is a lightweight object, you don't need to cache it. You
 * can just create a new one any time you need one.
