/**
 * The `GDBusConnection` type is used for D-Bus connections to remote
 * peers such as a message buses.
 * 
 * It is a low-level API that offers a lot of flexibility. For instance,
 * it lets you establish a connection over any transport that can by represented
 * as a [class@Gio.IOStream].
 * 
 * This class is rarely used directly in D-Bus clients. If you are writing
 * a D-Bus client, it is often easier to use the [func@Gio.bus_own_name],
 * [func@Gio.bus_watch_name] or [func@Gio.DBusProxy.new_for_bus] APIs.
 * 
 * As an exception to the usual GLib rule that a particular object must not
 * be used by two threads at the same time, `GDBusConnection`s methods may be
 * called from any thread. This is so that [func@Gio.bus_get] and
 * [func@Gio.bus_get_sync] can safely return the same `GDBusConnection` when
 * called from any thread.
 * 
 * Most of the ways to obtain a `GDBusConnection` automatically initialize it
 * (i.e. connect to D-Bus): for instance, [func@Gio.DBusConnection.new] and
 * [func@Gio.bus_get], and the synchronous versions of those methods, give you
 * an initialized connection. Language bindings for GIO should use
 * [func@Gio.Initable.new] or [func@Gio.AsyncInitable.new_async], which also
 * initialize the connection.
 * 
 * If you construct an uninitialized `GDBusConnection`, such as via
 * [ctor@GObject.Object.new], you must initialize it via [method@Gio.Initable.init] or
 * [method@Gio.AsyncInitable.init_async] before using its methods or properties.
 * Calling methods or accessing properties on a `GDBusConnection` that has not
 * completed initialization successfully is considered to be invalid, and leads
 * to undefined behaviour. In particular, if initialization fails with a
 * `GError`, the only valid thing you can do with that `GDBusConnection` is to
 * free it with [method@GObject.Object.unref].
 * 
 * ## An example D-Bus server
 * 
 * Here is an example for a D-Bus server:
 * [gdbus-example-server.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gdbus-example-server.c)

 * the message being processed. Filter functions are allowed to modify
 * and even drop messages.
 * 
 * Note that filters are run in a dedicated message handling thread so
 * they can't block and, generally, can't do anything but signal a

 * such as g_dbus_connection_send_message_with_reply(),
 * g_dbus_connection_signal_subscribe() or g_dbus_connection_call() instead.
 * 
 * If a filter consumes an incoming message the message is not
 * dispatched anywhere else - not even the standard dispatch machinery
 * (that API such as g_dbus_connection_signal_subscribe() and
