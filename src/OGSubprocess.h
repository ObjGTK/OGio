/**
 * `GSubprocess` allows the creation of and interaction with child
 * processes.
 * 
 * Processes can be communicated with using standard GIO-style APIs (ie:
 * [class@Gio.InputStream], [class@Gio.OutputStream]). There are GIO-style APIs
 * to wait for process termination (ie: cancellable and with an asynchronous
 * variant).
 * 
 * There is an API to force a process to terminate, as well as a
 * race-free API for sending UNIX signals to a subprocess.
 * 
 * One major advantage that GIO brings over the core GLib library is
 * comprehensive API for asynchronous I/O, such
 * [method@Gio.OutputStream.splice_async].  This makes `GSubprocess`
 * significantly more powerful and flexible than equivalent APIs in
 * some other languages such as the `subprocess.py`
 * included with Python.  For example, using `GSubprocess` one could
 * create two child processes, reading standard output from the first,
 * processing it, and writing to the input stream of the second, all
 * without blocking the main loop.
 * 
 * A powerful [method@Gio.Subprocess.communicate] API is provided similar to the
 * `communicate()` method of `subprocess.py`. This enables very easy
 * interaction with a subprocess that has been opened with pipes.
 * 
 * `GSubprocess` defaults to tight control over the file descriptors open
 * in the child process, avoiding dangling-FD issues that are caused by
 * a simple `fork()`/`exec()`.  The only open file descriptors in the
 * spawned process are ones that were explicitly specified by the
 * `GSubprocess` API (unless `G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_INHERIT_FDS` was
 * specified).
 * 
 * `GSubprocess` will quickly reap all child processes as they exit,
 * avoiding ‘zombie processes’ remaining around for long periods of
 * time.  [method@Gio.Subprocess.wait] can be used to wait for this to happen,
 * but it will happen even without the call being explicitly made.
 * 
 * As a matter of principle, `GSubprocess` has no API that accepts
 * shell-style space-separated strings.  It will, however, match the
 * typical shell behaviour of searching the `PATH` for executables that do
 * not contain a directory separator in their name. By default, the `PATH`
 * of the current process is used.  You can specify
 * `G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP` to use the `PATH` of the
 * launcher environment instead.
 * 
 * `GSubprocess` attempts to have a very simple API for most uses (ie:
 * spawning a subprocess with arguments and support for most typical
 * kinds of input and output redirection).  See [ctor@Gio.Subprocess.new]. The
 * [class@Gio.SubprocessLauncher] API is provided for more complicated cases
 * (advanced types of redirection, environment variable manipulation,
 * change of working directory, child setup functions, etc).
 * 
 * A typical use of `GSubprocess` will involve calling
 * [ctor@Gio.Subprocess.new], followed by [method@Gio.Subprocess.wait_async] or
 * [method@Gio.Subprocess.wait].  After the process exits, the status can be
 * checked using functions such as [method@Gio.Subprocess.get_if_exited] (which
 * are similar to the familiar `WIFEXITED`-style POSIX macros).

/**
 * Communicate with the subprocess until it terminates, and all input
 * and output has been completed.
 * 
 * If @stdin_buf is given, the subprocess must have been created with
 * %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDIN_PIPE.  The given data is fed to the
 * stdin of the subprocess and the pipe is closed (ie: EOF).
 * 
 * At the same time (as not to cause blocking when dealing with large
 * amounts of data), if %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDOUT_PIPE or
 * %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDERR_PIPE were used, reads from those
 * streams.  The data that was read is returned in @stdout and/or
 * the @stderr.
 * 
 * If the subprocess was created with %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDOUT_PIPE,
 * @stdout_buf will contain the data read from stdout.  Otherwise, for
 * subprocesses not created with %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDOUT_PIPE,
 * @stdout_buf will be set to %NULL.  Similar provisions apply to
 * @stderr_buf and %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDERR_PIPE.
 * 
 * As usual, any output variable may be given as %NULL to ignore it.
 * 
 * If you desire the stdout and stderr data to be interleaved, create
 * the subprocess with %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDOUT_PIPE and
 * %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_STDERR_MERGE.  The merged result will be returned
 * in @stdout_buf and @stderr_buf will be set to %NULL.
 * 
 * In case of any error (including cancellation), %FALSE will be
 * returned with @error set.  Some or all of the stdin data may have
 * been written.  Any stdout or stderr data that has been read will be
 * discarded. None of the out variables (aside from @error) will have
 * been set to anything in particular and should not be inspected.
 * 
 * In the case that %TRUE is returned, the subprocess has exited and the
 * exit status inspection APIs (eg: g_subprocess_get_if_exited(),
 * g_subprocess_get_exit_status()) may be used.
 * 
 * You should not attempt to use any of the subprocess pipes after
 * starting this function, since they may be left in strange states,
 * even if the operation was cancelled.  You should especially not
 * attempt to interact with the pipes while the operation is in progress
 * (either from another thread or if using the asynchronous version).
