/**
 * `GFileEnumerator` allows you to operate on a set of [iface@Gio.File] objects,
 * returning a [class@Gio.FileInfo] structure for each file enumerated (e.g.
 * [method@Gio.File.enumerate_children] will return a `GFileEnumerator` for each
 * of the children within a directory).
 * 
 * To get the next file's information from a `GFileEnumerator`, use
 * [method@Gio.FileEnumerator.next_file] or its asynchronous version,
 * [method@Gio.FileEnumerator.next_files_async]. Note that the asynchronous
 * version will return a list of [class@Gio.FileInfo] objects, whereas the
 * synchronous will only return the next file in the enumerator.
 * 
 * The ordering of returned files is unspecified for non-Unix
 * platforms; for more information, see [method@GLib.Dir.read_name].  On Unix,
 * when operating on local files, returned files will be sorted by
 * inode number.  Effectively you can assume that the ordering of
 * returned files will be stable between successive calls (and
 * applications) assuming the directory is unchanged.
 * 
 * If your application needs a specific ordering, such as by name or
 * modification time, you will have to implement that in your
 * application code.
 * 
 * To close a `GFileEnumerator`, use [method@Gio.FileEnumerator.close], or
 * its asynchronous version, [method@Gio.FileEnumerator.close_async]. Once
 * a `GFileEnumerator` is closed, no further actions may be performed
 * on it, and it should be freed with [method@GObject.Object.unref].

/**
 * This is a version of g_file_enumerator_next_file() that's easier to
 * use correctly from C programs.  With g_file_enumerator_next_file(),

 * requires allocation of a temporary #GError.
 * 
 * In contrast, with this function, a %FALSE return from
 * g_file_enumerator_iterate() *always* means
 * "error".  End of iteration is signaled by @out_info or @out_child being %NULL.
 * 
 * Another crucial difference is that the references for @out_info and
 * @out_child are owned by @direnum (they are cached as hidden
 * properties).  You must not unref them in your own code.  This makes
 * memory management significantly easier for C code in combination
 * with loops.
 * 
 * Finally, this function optionally allows retrieving a #GFile as
 * well.
 * 
 * You must specify at least one of @out_info or @out_child.
 * 
 * The code pattern for correctly using g_file_enumerator_iterate() from C
 * is:
 * 
 * |[
 * direnum = g_file_enumerate_children (file, ...);
 * while (TRUE)
 *   {
 *     GFileInfo *info;
 *     if (!g_file_enumerator_iterate (direnum, &info, NULL, cancellable, error))

 *     if (!info)
 *       break;
 *     ... do stuff with "info"; do not unref it! ...
 *   }
 * 
 * out:
 *   g_object_unref (direnum); // Note: frees the last @info
 * ]|

 * @param outChild Output location for the next #GFile, or %NULL
