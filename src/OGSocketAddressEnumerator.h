/**
 * `GSocketAddressEnumerator` is an enumerator type for

 * such as [method@Gio.SocketConnectable.enumerate], which returns a
 * `GSocketAddressEnumerator` to list each [class@Gio.SocketAddress] which could
 * be used to connect to that [iface@Gio.SocketConnectable].
 * 
 * Enumeration is typically a blocking operation, so the asynchronous methods
 * [method@Gio.SocketAddressEnumerator.next_async] and
 * [method@Gio.SocketAddressEnumerator.next_finish] should be used where
 * possible.
 * 
 * Each `GSocketAddressEnumerator` can only be enumerated once. Once
 * [method@Gio.SocketAddressEnumerator.next] has returned `NULL`, further
 * enumeration with that `GSocketAddressEnumerator` is not possible, and it can
 * be unreffed.
