 * 
 * If @cert is valid, %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_NO_FLAGS is returned.
 * 
 * If @identity is not %NULL, @cert's name(s) will be compared against

 * %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_UNKNOWN_CA will be set in the return value. If

 * GLib guarantees that if certificate verification fails, at least one
 * error will be set in the return value, but it does not guarantee
 * that all possible errors will be set. Accordingly, you may not safely
 * decide to ignore any particular type of error. For example, it would
 * be incorrect to mask %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED if you want to allow
 * expired certificates, because this could potentially be the only
 * error flag set even if other problems exist with the certificate.
 * 
 * Because TLS session context is not used, #GTlsCertificate may not
 * perform as many checks on the certificates as #GTlsConnection would.
 * For example, certificate constraints may not be honored, and
 * revocation checks may not be performed. The best way to verify TLS
 * certificates used by a TLS connection is to let #GTlsConnection
 * handle the verification.
