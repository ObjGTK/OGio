/**
 * As of GLib 2.46, `GSimpleAsyncResult` is deprecated in favor of
 * [class@Gio.Task], which provides a simpler API.
 * 
 * `GSimpleAsyncResult` implements [iface@Gio.AsyncResult].
 * 
 * `GSimpleAsyncResult` handles [type@Gio.AsyncReadyCallback]s, error
 * reporting, operation cancellation and the final state of an operation,
 * completely transparent to the application. Results can be returned
 * as a pointer e.g. for functions that return data that is collected
 * asynchronously, a boolean value for checking the success or failure
 * of an operation, or a `gssize` for operations which return the number
 * of bytes modified by the operation; all of the simple return cases
 * are covered.
 * 
 * Most of the time, an application will not need to know of the details
 * of this API; it is handled transparently, and any necessary operations
 * are handled by [iface@Gio.AsyncResult]’s interface. However, if implementing
 * a new GIO module, for writing language bindings, or for complex
 * applications that need better control of how asynchronous operations
 * are completed, it is important to understand this functionality.
 * 
 * `GSimpleAsyncResult`s are tagged with the calling function to ensure
 * that asynchronous functions and their finishing functions are used
 * together correctly.
 * 
 * To create a new `GSimpleAsyncResult`, call [ctor@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.new].
 * If the result needs to be created for a `GError`, use
 * [ctor@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.new_from_error] or
 * [ctor@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.new_take_error]. If a `GError` is not available
 * (e.g. the asynchronous operation doesn’t take a `GError` argument),
 * but the result still needs to be created for an error condition, use
 * [ctor@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.new_error] (or
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.set_error_va] if your application or binding
 * requires passing a variable argument list directly), and the error can then
 * be propagated through the use of
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.propagate_error].
 * 
 * An asynchronous operation can be made to ignore a cancellation event by
 * calling [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.set_handle_cancellation] with a
 * `GSimpleAsyncResult` for the operation and `FALSE`. This is useful for
 * operations that are dangerous to cancel, such as close (which would
 * cause a leak if cancelled before being run).
 * 
 * `GSimpleAsyncResult` can integrate into GLib’s event loop,
 * [type@GLib.MainLoop], or it can use [type@GLib.Thread]s.
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.complete] will finish an I/O task directly
 * from the point where it is called.
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.complete_in_idle] will finish it from an idle
 * handler in the  thread-default main context (see
 * [method@GLib.MainContext.push_thread_default]) where the `GSimpleAsyncResult`
 * was created. [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.run_in_thread] will run the job in
 * a separate thread and then use
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.complete_in_idle] to deliver the result.
 * 
 * To set the results of an asynchronous function,
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.set_op_res_gpointer],
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.set_op_res_gboolean], and
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.set_op_res_gssize]
 * are provided, setting the operation's result to a `gpointer`, `gboolean`, or
 * `gssize`, respectively.
 * 
 * Likewise, to get the result of an asynchronous function,
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.get_op_res_gpointer],
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.get_op_res_gboolean], and
 * [method@Gio.SimpleAsyncResult.get_op_res_gssize] are
 * provided, getting the operation’s result as a `gpointer`, `gboolean`, and
 * `gssize`, respectively.
 * 
 * For the details of the requirements implementations must respect, see
 * [iface@Gio.AsyncResult].  A typical implementation of an asynchronous
 * operation using `GSimpleAsyncResult` looks something like this:
 * 
 * ```c
 * static void
 * baked_cb (Cake    *cake,
 *           gpointer user_data)
 * {
 *   // In this example, this callback is not given a reference to the cake,
 *   // so the GSimpleAsyncResult has to take a reference to it.
 *   GSimpleAsyncResult *result = user_data;
 * 
 *   if (cake == NULL)
 *     g_simple_async_result_set_error (result,
 *                                      BAKER_ERRORS,
 *                                      BAKER_ERROR_NO_FLOUR,
 *                                      "Go to the supermarket");
 *   else
 *     g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gpointer (result,
 *                                                g_object_ref (cake),
 *                                                g_object_unref);
 * 
 * 
 *   // In this example, we assume that baked_cb is called as a callback from
 *   // the mainloop, so it's safe to complete the operation synchronously here.
 *   // If, however, _baker_prepare_cake () might call its callback without
 *   // first returning to the mainloop — inadvisable, but some APIs do so —
 *   // we would need to use g_simple_async_result_complete_in_idle().
 *   g_simple_async_result_complete (result);
 *   g_object_unref (result);
 * }
