/**
 * A `GSocketListener` is an object that keeps track of a set
 * of server sockets and helps you accept sockets from any of the
 * socket, either sync or async.
 * 
 * Add addresses and ports to listen on using
 * [method@Gio.SocketListener.add_address] and
 * [method@Gio.SocketListener.add_inet_port]. These will be listened on until
 * [method@Gio.SocketListener.close] is called. Dropping your final reference to
 * the `GSocketListener` will not cause [method@Gio.SocketListener.close] to be
 * called implicitly, as some references to the `GSocketListener` may be held
 * internally.
 * 
 * If you want to implement a network server, also look at
 * [class@Gio.SocketService] and [class@Gio.ThreadedSocketService] which are
 * subclasses of `GSocketListener` that make this even easier.
