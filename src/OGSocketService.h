/**
 * A #GSocketService is an object that represents a service that
 * is provided to the network or over local sockets.  When a new
 * connection is made to the service the #GSocketService::incoming
 * signal is emitted.
 * 
 * A #GSocketService is a subclass of #GSocketListener and you need
 * to add the addresses you want to accept connections on with the
 * #GSocketListener APIs.
 * 
 * There are two options for implementing a network service based on
 * #GSocketService. The first is to create the service using
 * g_socket_service_new() and to connect to the #GSocketService::incoming
 * signal. The second is to subclass #GSocketService and override the
 * default signal handler implementation.
 * 
 * In either case, the handler must immediately return, or else it
 * will block additional incoming connections from being serviced.
 * If you are interested in writing connection handlers that contain
 * blocking code then see #GThreadedSocketService.
 * 
 * The socket service runs on the main loop of the
 * [thread-default context][g-main-context-push-thread-default-context]
 * of the thread it is created in, and is not
 * threadsafe in general. However, the calls to start and stop the
 * service are thread-safe so these can be used from threads that
 * handle incoming clients.
