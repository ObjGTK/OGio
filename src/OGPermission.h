/**
 * A `GPermission` represents the status of the caller’s permission to
 * perform a certain action.
 * 
 * You can query if the action is currently allowed and if it is
 * possible to acquire the permission so that the action will be allowed
 * in the future.
 * 
 * There is also an API to actually acquire the permission and one to
 * release it.
 * 
 * As an example, a `GPermission` might represent the ability for the
 * user to write to a [class@Gio.Settings] object.  This `GPermission` object
 * could then be used to decide if it is appropriate to show a “Click here to
 * unlock” button in a dialog and to provide the mechanism to invoke
 * when that button is clicked.
