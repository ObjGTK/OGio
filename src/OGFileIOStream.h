/**
 * `GFileIOStream` provides I/O streams that both read and write to the same
 * file handle.
 * 
 * `GFileIOStream` implements [iface@Gio.Seekable], which allows the I/O
 * stream to jump to arbitrary positions in the file and to truncate
 * the file, provided the filesystem of the file supports these
 * operations.
 * 
 * To find the position of a file I/O stream, use [method@Gio.Seekable.tell].
 * 
 * To find out if a file I/O stream supports seeking, use
 * [method@Gio.Seekable.can_seek]. To position a file I/O stream, use
 * [method@Gio.Seekable.seek]. To find out if a file I/O stream supports
 * truncating, use [method@Gio.Seekable.can_truncate]. To truncate a file I/O
 * stream, use [method@Gio.Seekable.truncate].
 * 
 * The default implementation of all the `GFileIOStream` operations
 * and the implementation of [iface@Gio.Seekable] just call into the same
 * operations on the output stream.
