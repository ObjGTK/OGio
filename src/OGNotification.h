/**
 * `GNotification` is a mechanism for creating a notification to be shown
 * to the user — typically as a pop-up notification presented by the
 * desktop environment shell.
 * 
 * The key difference between `GNotification` and other similar APIs is
 * that, if supported by the desktop environment, notifications sent
 * with `GNotification` will persist after the application has exited,
 * and even across system reboots.
 * 
 * Since the user may click on a notification while the application is
 * not running, applications using `GNotification` should be able to be
 * started as a D-Bus service, using [class@Gio.Application].
 * 
 * In order for `GNotification` to work, the application must have installed
 * a `.desktop` file. For example:
 * ```
 * [Desktop Entry]
 * Name=Test Application
 * Comment=Description of what Test Application does
 * Exec=gnome-test-application
 * Icon=org.gnome.TestApplication
 * Terminal=false
 * Type=Application
 * Categories=GNOME;GTK;TestApplication Category;
 * StartupNotify=true
 * DBusActivatable=true
 * X-GNOME-UsesNotifications=true
 * ```
 * 
 * The `X-GNOME-UsesNotifications` key indicates to GNOME Control Center
 * that this application uses notifications, so it can be listed in the
 * Control Center’s ‘Notifications’ panel.
 * 
 * The `.desktop` file must be named as `org.gnome.TestApplication.desktop`,
 * where `org.gnome.TestApplication` is the ID passed to
 * [ctor@Gio.Application.new].
 * 
 * User interaction with a notification (either the default action, or
 * buttons) must be associated with actions on the application (ie:
 * `app.` actions).  It is not possible to route user interaction
 * through the notification itself, because the object will not exist if
 * the application is autostarted as a result of a notification being
 * clicked.
 * 
 * A notification can be sent with [method@Gio.Application.send_notification].
 *
