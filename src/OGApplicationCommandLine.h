/**
 * `GApplicationCommandLine` represents a command-line invocation of
 * an application.
 * 
 * It is created by [class@Gio.Application] and emitted
 * in the [signal@Gio.Application::command-line] signal and virtual function.
 * 
 * The class contains the list of arguments that the program was invoked
 * with. It is also possible to query if the commandline invocation was
 * local (ie: the current process is running in direct response to the
 * invocation) or remote (ie: some other process forwarded the
 * commandline to this process).
 * 
 * The `GApplicationCommandLine` object can provide the @argc and @argv
 * parameters for use with the [struct@GLib.OptionContext] command-line parsing API,
 * with the [method@Gio.ApplicationCommandLine.get_arguments] function. See
 * [gapplication-example-cmdline3.c][gapplication-example-cmdline3]
 * for an example.
 * 
 * The exit status of the originally-invoked process may be set and
 * messages can be printed to stdout or stderr of that process.
 * 
 * For remote invocation, the originally-invoked process exits when
 * [method@Gio.ApplicationCommandLine.done] method is called. This method is
 * also automatically called when the object is disposed.
 * 
 * The main use for `GApplicationCommandLine` (and the
 * [signal@Gio.Application::command-line] signal) is 'Emacs server' like use cases:
 * You can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to have e.g. git use
 * your favourite editor to edit commit messages, and if you already
 * have an instance of the editor running, the editing will happen
 * in the running instance, instead of opening a new one. An important
 * aspect of this use case is that the process that gets started by git
 * does not return until the editing is done.
 * 
 * Normally, the commandline is completely handled in the
 * [signal@Gio.Application::command-line] handler. The launching instance exits
 * once the signal handler in the primary instance has returned, and
 * the return value of the signal handler becomes the exit status
 * of the launching instance.
 * 
 * ```c
 * static int
 * command_line (GApplication            *application,
 *               GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline)
 * {
 *   gchar **argv;
 *   gint argc;
 *   gint i;
 * 
 *   argv = g_application_command_line_get_arguments (cmdline, &argc);
 * 
 *   g_application_command_line_print (cmdline,
 *                                     "This text is written back\n"
 *                                     "to stdout of the caller\n");
 * 
 *   for (i = 0; i < argc; i++)
 *     g_print ("argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
 * 
 *   g_strfreev (argv);
 * 
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * The complete example can be found here:
 * [gapplication-example-cmdline.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline.c)
 * 
 * In more complicated cases, the handling of the commandline can be
 * split between the launcher and the primary instance.
 * 
 * ```c
 * static gboolean
 *  test_local_cmdline (GApplication   *application,
 *                      gchar        ***arguments,
 *                      gint           *exit_status)
 * {
 *   gint i, j;
 *   gchar **argv;
 * 
 *   argv = *arguments;
 * 
 *   if (argv[0] == NULL)
 *     {
 *       *exit_status = 0;
 *       return FALSE;
 *     }
 * 
 *   i = 1;
 *   while (argv[i])
 *     {
 *       if (g_str_has_prefix (argv[i], "--local-"))
 *         {
 *           g_print ("handling argument %s locally\n", argv[i]);
 *           g_free (argv[i]);
 *           for (j = i; argv[j]; j++)
 *             argv[j] = argv[j + 1];
 *         }
 *       else
 *         {
 *           g_print ("not handling argument %s locally\n", argv[i]);
 *           i++;
 *         }
 *     }
 * 
 *   *exit_status = 0;
 * 
 *   return FALSE;
 * }
 * 
 * static void
 * test_application_class_init (TestApplicationClass *class)
 * {
 *   G_APPLICATION_CLASS (class)->local_command_line = test_local_cmdline;
 * 
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * In this example of split commandline handling, options that start
 * with `--local-` are handled locally, all other options are passed
 * to the [signal@Gio.Application::command-line] handler which runs in the primary
 * instance.
 * 
 * The complete example can be found here:
 * [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c)
 * 
 * If handling the commandline requires a lot of work, it may be better to defer it.
 * 
 * ```c
 * static gboolean
 * my_cmdline_handler (gpointer data)
 * {
 *   GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline = data;
 * 
 *   // do the heavy lifting in an idle
 * 
 *   g_application_command_line_set_exit_status (cmdline, 0);
 *   g_object_unref (cmdline); // this releases the application
 * 
 *   return G_SOURCE_REMOVE;
 * }
 * 
 * static int
 * command_line (GApplication            *application,
 *               GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline)
 * {
 *   // keep the application running until we are done with this commandline
 *   g_application_hold (application);
 * 
 *   g_object_set_data_full (G_OBJECT (cmdline),
 *                           "application", application,
 *                           (GDestroyNotify)g_application_release);
 * 
 *   g_object_ref (cmdline);
 *   g_idle_add (my_cmdline_handler, cmdline);
 * 
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * In this example the commandline is not completely handled before
 * the [signal@Gio.Application::command-line] handler returns. Instead, we keep
 * a reference to the `GApplicationCommandLine` object and handle it
 * later (in this example, in an idle). Note that it is necessary to
 * hold the application until you are done with the commandline.
 * 
 * The complete example can be found here:
 * [gapplication-example-cmdline3.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline3.c)
