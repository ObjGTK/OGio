 * 
 * Since GLib 2.72, `GUnixConnection` is available on all platforms. It requires
 * underlying system support (such as Windows 10 with `AF_UNIX`) at run time.
 * 
 * Before GLib 2.72, `<gio/gunixconnection.h>` belonged to the UNIX-specific GIO

 * using it. This is no longer necessary since GLib 2.72.
