/**
 * `GMenuModel` represents the contents of a menu — an ordered list of
 * menu items. The items are associated with actions, which can be
 * activated through them. Items can be grouped in sections, and may
 * have submenus associated with them. Both items and sections usually
 * have some representation data, such as labels or icons. The type of
 * the associated action (ie whether it is stateful, and what kind of
 * state it has) can influence the representation of the item.
 * 
 * The conceptual model of menus in `GMenuModel` is hierarchical:
 * sections and submenus are again represented by `GMenuModel`s.
 * Menus themselves do not define their own roles. Rather, the role
 * of a particular `GMenuModel` is defined by the item that references
 * it (or, in the case of the ‘root’ menu, is defined by the context
 * in which it is used).
 * 
 * As an example, consider the visible portions of this menu:
 * 
 * ## An example menu
 * 
 * ![](menu-example.png)
 * 
 * There are 8 ‘menus’ visible in the screenshot: one menubar, two
 * submenus and 5 sections:
 * 
 * - the toplevel menubar (containing 4 items)
 * - the View submenu (containing 3 sections)
 * - the first section of the View submenu (containing 2 items)
 * - the second section of the View submenu (containing 1 item)
 * - the final section of the View submenu (containing 1 item)
 * - the Highlight Mode submenu (containing 2 sections)
 * - the Sources section (containing 2 items)
 * - the Markup section (containing 2 items)
 * 
 * The [example](#a-menu-example) illustrates the conceptual connection between
 * these 8 menus. Each large block in the figure represents a menu and the
 * smaller blocks within the large block represent items in that menu. Some
 * items contain references to other menus.
 * 
 * ## A menu example
 * 
 * ![](menu-model.png)
 * 
 * Notice that the separators visible in the [example](#an-example-menu)
 * appear nowhere in the [menu model](#a-menu-example). This is because
 * separators are not explicitly represented in the menu model. Instead,
 * a separator is inserted between any two non-empty sections of a menu.
 * Section items can have labels just like any other item. In that case,
 * a display system may show a section header instead of a separator.
 * 
 * The motivation for this abstract model of application controls is
 * that modern user interfaces tend to make these controls available
 * outside the application. Examples include global menus, jumplists,
 * dash boards, etc. To support such uses, it is necessary to ‘export’
 * information about actions and their representation in menus, which
 * is exactly what the action group exporter and the menu model exporter do for
 * [iface@Gio.ActionGroup] and [class@Gio.MenuModel]. The client-side
 * counterparts to make use of the exported information are
 * [class@Gio.DBusActionGroup] and [class@Gio.DBusMenuModel].
 * 
 * The API of `GMenuModel` is very generic, with iterators for the
 * attributes and links of an item, see
 * [method@Gio.MenuModel.iterate_item_attributes] and
 * [method@Gio.MenuModel.iterate_item_links]. The ‘standard’ attributes and
 * link types have predefined names: `G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_LABEL`,
 * `G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION`, `G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_TARGET`, `G_MENU_LINK_SECTION`
 * and `G_MENU_LINK_SUBMENU`.
 * 
 * Items in a `GMenuModel` represent active controls if they refer to
 * an action that can get activated when the user interacts with the
 * menu item. The reference to the action is encoded by the string ID
 * in the `G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION` attribute. An action ID uniquely
 * identifies an action in an action group. Which action group(s) provide
 * actions depends on the context in which the menu model is used.
 * E.g. when the model is exported as the application menu of a
 * [`GtkApplication`](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Application.html),
 * actions can be application-wide or window-specific (and thus come from
 * two different action groups). By convention, the application-wide actions
 * have names that start with `app.`, while the names of window-specific
 * actions start with `win.`.
 * 
 * While a wide variety of stateful actions is possible, the following
 * is the minimum that is expected to be supported by all users of exported
 * menu information:
 * - an action with no parameter type and no state
 * - an action with no parameter type and boolean state
 * - an action with string parameter type and string state
 * 
 * ## Stateless
 * 
 * A stateless action typically corresponds to an ordinary menu item.
 * 
 * Selecting such a menu item will activate the action (with no parameter).
 * 
 * ## Boolean State
 * 
 * An action with a boolean state will most typically be used with a ‘toggle’
 * or ‘switch’ menu item. The state can be set directly, but activating the
 * action (with no parameter) results in the state being toggled.
 * 
 * Selecting a toggle menu item will activate the action. The menu item should
 * be rendered as ‘checked’ when the state is true.
 * 
 * ## String Parameter and State
 * 
 * Actions with string parameters and state will most typically be used to
 * represent an enumerated choice over the items available for a group of
 * radio menu items. Activating the action with a string parameter is
 * equivalent to setting that parameter as the state.
 * 
 * Radio menu items, in addition to being associated with the action, will
 * have a target value. Selecting that menu item will result in activation
 * of the action with the target value as the parameter. The menu item should
 * be rendered as ‘selected’ when the state of the action is equal to the
 * target value of the menu item.
