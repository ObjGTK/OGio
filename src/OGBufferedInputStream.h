/**
 * Buffered input stream implements #GFilterInputStream and provides

 * By default, `GBufferedInputStream`'s buffer size is set at 4 kilobytes.
 * 
 * To create a buffered input stream, use [ctor@Gio.BufferedInputStream.new],
 * or [ctor@Gio.BufferedInputStream.new_sized] to specify the buffer's size at
 * construction.
 * 
 * To get the size of a buffer within a buffered input stream, use
 * [method@Gio.BufferedInputStream.get_buffer_size]. To change the size of a
 * buffered input stream's buffer, use [method@Gio.BufferedInputStream.set_buffer_size].
 * Note that the buffer's size cannot be reduced below the size of the data within the buffer.

/**
 * Tries to read @count bytes from the stream into the buffer.

 * 
 * If @count is zero, returns zero and does nothing. A value of @count
 * larger than %G_MAXSSIZE will cause a %G_IO_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
 * 
 * On success, the number of bytes read into the buffer is returned.
 * It is not an error if this is not the same as the requested size, as it
 * can happen e.g. near the end of a file. Zero is returned on end of file
 * (or if @count is zero),  but never otherwise.
 * 
 * If @count is -1 then the attempted read size is equal to the number of
 * bytes that are required to fill the buffer.
 * 
 * If @cancellable is not %NULL, then the operation can be cancelled by
 * triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
 * was cancelled, the error %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If an
 * operation was partially finished when the operation was cancelled the
 * partial result will be returned, without an error.
 * 
 * On error -1 is returned and @error is set accordingly.
