/**
 * `GApplication` is the core class for application support.
 * 
 * A `GApplication` is the foundation of an application. It wraps some
 * low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
 * foundation for higher-level application classes such as
 * `GtkApplication` or `MxApplication`. In general, you should not use
 * this class outside of a higher level framework.
 * 
 * `GApplication` provides convenient life-cycle management by maintaining
 * a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
 * be changed using [method@Gio.Application.hold] and
 * [method@Gio.Application.release]. If it drops to zero, the application
 * exits. Higher-level classes such as `GtkApplication` employ the use count
 * to ensure that the application stays alive as long as it has any opened
 * windows.
 * 
 * Another feature that `GApplication` (optionally) provides is process
 * uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
 * providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
 * with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
 * concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
 * desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
 * arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
 * running program. The already running instance of the program is
 * called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
 * always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
 * is used for communication.
 * 
 * The use of `GApplication` differs from some other commonly-used
 * uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
 * application is not expected to manually register itself and check
 * if it is the primary instance. Instead, the main() function of a
 * `GApplication` should do very little more than instantiating the
 * application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
 * calling [method@Gio.Application.run]. All checks for uniqueness are done
 * internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
 * startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
 * is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
 * instance and [method@Gio.Application.run] promptly returns. See the code
 * examples below.
 * 
 * If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the
 * same as that of a
 * [D-Bus well-known bus name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
 * Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`, `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`,
 * `org._7_zip.Archiver`.
 * For details on valid application identifiers, see [func@Gio.Application.id_is_valid].
 * 
 * On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
 * on the user's session bus. This means that the uniqueness of your
 * application is scoped to the current session. It also means that your
 * application may provide additional services (through registration of other
 * object paths) at that bus name. The registration of these object paths
 * should be done with the shared GDBus session bus. Note that due to the
 * internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
 * (even if a main loop is not running). For this reason, you must ensure that
 * any object paths that you wish to register are registered before #GApplication
 * attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
 * [method@Gio.Application.register]). Unfortunately, this means that you cannot
 * use [property@Gio.Application:is-remote] to decide if you want to register
 * object paths.
 * 
 * `GApplication` also implements the [iface@Gio.ActionGroup] and [iface@Gio.ActionMap]
 * interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
 * [method@Gio.ActionMap.add_action]. When invoking an action by calling
 * [method@Gio.ActionGroup.activate_action] on the application, it is always
 * invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
 * the session bus, and GIO provides the [class@Gio.DBusActionGroup] wrapper to
 * conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a [class@Gio.DBusMenuModel] wrapper
 * for remote access to exported [class@Gio.MenuModel]s.
 * 
 * Note: Due to the fact that actions are exported on the session bus,
 * using `maybe` parameters is not supported, since D-Bus does not support
 * `maybe` types.
 * 
 * There is a number of different entry points into a `GApplication`:
 * 
 * - via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
 * 
 * - via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
 * 
 * - by handling a command-line
 * 
 * - via activating an action
 * 
 * The [signal@Gio.Application::startup] signal lets you handle the application
 * initialization for all of these in a single place.
 * 
 * Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the
 * application, `GApplication` passes some ‘platform data’ from the
 * launching instance to the primary instance, in the form of a
 * [struct@GLib.Variant] dictionary mapping strings to variants. To use platform
 * data, override the [vfunc@Gio.Application.before_emit] or
 * [vfunc@Gio.Application.after_emit] virtual functions
 * in your `GApplication` subclass. When dealing with
 * [class@Gio.ApplicationCommandLine] objects, the platform data is
 * directly available via [method@Gio.ApplicationCommandLine.get_cwd],
 * [method@Gio.ApplicationCommandLine.get_environ] and
 * [method@Gio.ApplicationCommandLine.get_platform_data].
 * 
 * As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
 * operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
 * `cwd`), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
 * variables and their values) of the calling process (key `environ`).
 * The environment is only added to the platform data if the
 * `G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIRONMENT` flag is set. `GApplication` subclasses
 * can add their own platform data by overriding the
 * [vfunc@Gio.Application.add_platform_data] virtual function. For instance,
 * `GtkApplication` adds startup notification data in this way.
 * 
 * To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
 * [signal@Gio.Application::command-line] signal or override the
 * [vfunc@Gio.Application.local_command_line] virtual funcion, to parse them in
 * either the primary instance or the local instance, respectively.
 * 
 * For an example of opening files with a `GApplication`, see
 * [gapplication-example-open.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-open.c).
 * 
 * For an example of using actions with `GApplication`, see
 * [gapplication-example-actions.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-actions.c).
 * 
 * For an example of using extra D-Bus hooks with `GApplication`, see
 * [gapplication-example-dbushooks.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-dbushooks.c).

/**
 * Checks if @application_id is a valid application identifier.
 * 
 * A valid ID is required for calls to g_application_new() and

 * 
 * Application identifiers follow the same format as
 * [D-Bus well-known bus names](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
 * For convenience, the restrictions on application identifiers are
 * reproduced here:
 * 
 * - Application identifiers are composed of 1 or more elements separated by a
 *   period (`.`) character. All elements must contain at least one character.
 * 
 * - Each element must only contain the ASCII characters `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_-`,
 *   with `-` discouraged in new application identifiers. Each element must not
 *   begin with a digit.
 * 
 * - Application identifiers must contain at least one `.` (period) character
 *   (and thus at least two elements).
 * 
 * - Application identifiers must not begin with a `.` (period) character.
 * 
 * - Application identifiers must not exceed 255 characters.
 * 
 * Note that the hyphen (`-`) character is allowed in application identifiers,
 * but is problematic or not allowed in various specifications and APIs that
 * refer to D-Bus, such as
 * [Flatpak application IDs](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/introduction.html#identifiers),
 * the
 * [`DBusActivatable` interface in the Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#dbus),
 * and the convention that an application's "main" interface and object path
 * resemble its application identifier and bus name. To avoid situations that
 * require special-case handling, it is recommended that new application
 * identifiers consistently replace hyphens with underscores.
 * 
 * Like D-Bus interface names, application identifiers should start with the
 * reversed DNS domain name of the author of the interface (in lower-case), and
 * it is conventional for the rest of the application identifier to consist of
 * words run together, with initial capital letters.
 * 
 * As with D-Bus interface names, if the author's DNS domain name contains
 * hyphen/minus characters they should be replaced by underscores, and if it
 * contains leading digits they should be escaped by prepending an underscore.
 * For example, if the owner of 7-zip.org used an application identifier for an
 * archiving application, it might be named `org._7_zip.Archiver`.

 * in the given #GOptionEntrys.
 * 
 * Unlike #GOptionContext, #GApplication supports giving a %NULL
 * @arg_data for a non-callback #GOptionEntry.  This results in the
 * argument in question being packed into a #GVariantDict which is also
 * passed to #GApplication::handle-local-options, where it can be
 * inspected and modified.  If %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is
 * set, then the resulting dictionary is sent to the primary instance,
 * where g_application_command_line_get_options_dict() will return it.
 * As it has been passed outside the process at this point, the types of all
 * values in the options dict must be checked before being used.
 * This "packing" is done according to the type of the argument --
 * booleans for normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for
 * filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
 * do not pack a "false" #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
 * 
 * In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
 * parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
 * transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
 * g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used.  For local options, it is
 * possible to either use @arg_data in the usual way, or to consult (and
 * potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.
 * 
 * This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
 * was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
 * primary instance for handling.  #GApplication ignored them completely
 * on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
 * behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
 * treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
 * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
 * 
 * If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
 * filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
 * @arg_data is %NULL then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
 * the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
 * need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
 * consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
 * (which treats them as filenames to be opened).
 * 
 * It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving
 * the options with g_variant_dict_lookup():
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use `b`
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING, use `&s`
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT, use `i`
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT64, use `x`
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_DOUBLE, use `d`
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME, use `^&ay`

 * #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
 * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN was specified then the files are opened
 * via the #GApplication::open signal.
 * 
 * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
 * commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
 * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
 * to return %TRUE from your local_command_line() implementation to

 * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
 * non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
 * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
 * 
 * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
 * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
 * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
 * if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
 * except in the case that g_application_set_inactivity_timeout() is in
 * use.
 * 
 * This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname()), if not already set,
 * to the basename of argv[0].
 * 
 * Much like g_main_loop_run(), this function will acquire the main context
 * for the duration that the application is running.
 * 
 * Since 2.40, applications that are not explicitly flagged as services
 * or launchers (ie: neither %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE or
 * %G_APPLICATION_IS_LAUNCHER are given as flags) will check (from the
 * default handler for local_command_line) if "--gapplication-service"
 * was given in the command line.  If this flag is present then normal
 * commandline processing is interrupted and the
 * %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set.  This provides a "compromise"
 * solution whereby running an application directly from the commandline
 * will invoke it in the normal way (which can be useful for debugging)
 * while still allowing applications to be D-Bus activated in service
 * mode.  The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
 * "--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument.  This
 * approach is suitable for use by most graphical applications but
 * should not be used from applications like editors that need precise
 * control over when processes invoked via the commandline will exit and
 * what their exit status will be.
