 * This [class@Gio.SocketControlMessage] contains a [class@Gio.UnixFDList].

 * `G_SOCKET_FAMILY_UNIX` family). The file descriptors are copied
 * between processes by the kernel.
 * 
 * For an easier way to send and receive file descriptors over
 * stream-oriented UNIX sockets, see [method@Gio.UnixConnection.send_fd] and
 * [method@Gio.UnixConnection.receive_fd].
 * 
 * Note that `<gio/gunixfdmessage.h>` belongs to the UNIX-specific GIO
 * interfaces, thus you have to use the `gio-unix-2.0.pc` pkg-config
 * file or the `GioUnix-2.0` GIR namespace when using it.
