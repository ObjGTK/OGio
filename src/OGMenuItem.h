 * If @action is non-%NULL then the "action" attribute is set.  The

 * 
 * Normal menu items (ie: not submenu, section or other custom item
 * types) are expected to have the "action" attribute set to identify
 * the action that they are associated with.  The state type of the
 * action help to determine the disposition of the menu item.  See
 * #GAction and #GActionGroup for an overview of actions.
 * 
 * In general, clicking on the menu item will result in activation of
 * the named action with the "target" attribute given as the parameter
 * to the action invocation.  If the "target" attribute is not set then
 * the action is invoked with no parameter.
 * 
 * If the action has no state then the menu item is usually drawn as a
 * plain menu item (ie: with no additional decoration).
 * 
 * If the action has a boolean state then the menu item is usually drawn
 * as a toggle menu item (ie: with a checkmark or equivalent
 * indication).  The item should be marked as 'toggled' or 'checked'
 * when the boolean state is %TRUE.
 * 
 * If the action has a string state then the menu item is usually drawn
 * as a radio menu item (ie: with a radio bullet or equivalent
 * indication).  The item should be marked as 'selected' when the string
 * state is equal to the value of the @target property.
 * 
 * See g_menu_item_set_action_and_target() or
 * g_menu_item_set_detailed_action() for two equivalent calls that are
 * probably more convenient for most uses.
