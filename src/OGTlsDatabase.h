/**
 * Determines the validity of a certificate chain, outside the context
 * of a TLS session.
 * 
 * @chain is a chain of #GTlsCertificate objects each pointing to the next
 * certificate in the chain by its #GTlsCertificate:issuer property.
 * 
 * @purpose describes the purpose (or usage) for which the certificate
 * is being used. Typically @purpose will be set to %G_TLS_DATABASE_PURPOSE_AUTHENTICATE_SERVER
 * which means that the certificate is being used to authenticate a server
 * (and we are acting as the client).
 * 
 * The @identity is used to ensure the server certificate is valid for
 * the expected peer identity. If the identity does not match the
 * certificate, %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_BAD_IDENTITY will be set in the
 * return value. If @identity is %NULL, that bit will never be set in
 * the return value. The peer identity may also be used to check for
 * pinned certificates (trust exceptions) in the database. These may
 * override the normal verification process on a host-by-host basis.
 * 
 * Currently there are no @flags, and %G_TLS_DATABASE_VERIFY_NONE should be
 * used.
 * 
 * If @chain is found to be valid, then the return value will be 0. If
 * @chain is found to be invalid, then the return value will indicate at
 * least one problem found. If the function is unable to determine
 * whether @chain is valid (for example, because @cancellable is
 * triggered before it completes) then the return value will be
 * %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_GENERIC_ERROR and @error will be set accordingly.
 * @error is not set when @chain is successfully analyzed but found to
 * be invalid.
 * 
 * GLib guarantees that if certificate verification fails, at least one
 * error will be set in the return value, but it does not guarantee
 * that all possible errors will be set. Accordingly, you may not safely
 * decide to ignore any particular type of error. For example, it would
 * be incorrect to mask %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED if you want to allow
 * expired certificates, because this could potentially be the only
 * error flag set even if other problems exist with the certificate.
 * 
 * Prior to GLib 2.48, GLib's default TLS backend modified @chain to
 * represent the certification path built by #GTlsDatabase during
 * certificate verification by adjusting the #GTlsCertificate:issuer
 * property of each certificate in @chain. Since GLib 2.48, this no
 * longer occurs, so you cannot rely on #GTlsCertificate:issuer to
 * represent the actual certification path used during certificate
 * verification.
 * 
 * Because TLS session context is not used, #GTlsDatabase may not
 * perform as many checks on the certificates as #GTlsConnection would.
 * For example, certificate constraints may not be honored, and
 * revocation checks may not be performed. The best way to verify TLS
 * certificates used by a TLS connection is to let #GTlsConnection
 * handle the verification.
 * 
 * The TLS backend may attempt to look up and add missing certificates
 * to the chain. This may involve HTTP requests to download missing
 * certificates.
 * 
 * This function can block. Use g_tls_database_verify_chain_async() to
 * perform the verification operation asynchronously.
 *
 * @param chain a #GTlsCertificate chain
