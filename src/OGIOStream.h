/**
 * `GIOStream` represents an object that has both read and write streams.
 * Generally the two streams act as separate input and output streams,
 * but they share some common resources and state. For instance, for
 * seekable streams, both streams may use the same position.
 * 
 * Examples of `GIOStream` objects are [class@Gio.SocketConnection], which represents
 * a two-way network connection; and [class@Gio.FileIOStream], which represents a
 * file handle opened in read-write mode.
 * 
 * To do the actual reading and writing you need to get the substreams
 * with [method@Gio.IOStream.get_input_stream] and
 * [method@Gio.IOStream.get_output_stream].
 * 
 * The `GIOStream` object owns the input and the output streams, not the other
 * way around, so keeping the substreams alive will not keep the `GIOStream`
 * object alive. If the `GIOStream` object is freed it will be closed, thus
 * closing the substreams, so even if the substreams stay alive they will
 * always return `G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED` for all operations.
 * 
 * To close a stream use [method@Gio.IOStream.close] which will close the common
 * stream object and also the individual substreams. You can also close
 * the substreams themselves. In most cases this only marks the
 * substream as closed, so further I/O on it fails but common state in the
 * `GIOStream` may still be open. However, some streams may support
 * ‘half-closed’ states where one direction of the stream is actually shut down.
 * 
 * Operations on `GIOStream`s cannot be started while another operation on the
 * `GIOStream` or its substreams is in progress. Specifically, an application can
 * read from the [class@Gio.InputStream] and write to the
 * [class@Gio.OutputStream] simultaneously (either in separate threads, or as
 * asynchronous operations in the same thread), but an application cannot start
 * any `GIOStream` operation while there is a `GIOStream`, `GInputStream` or
 * `GOutputStream` operation in progress, and an application can’t start any
 * `GInputStream` or `GOutputStream` operation while there is a `GIOStream`
 * operation in progress.
 * 
 * This is a product of individual stream operations being associated with a
 * given [type@GLib.MainContext] (the thread-default context at the time the
 * operation was started), rather than entire streams being associated with a
 * single `GMainContext`.
 * 
 * GIO may run operations on `GIOStream`s from other (worker) threads, and this
 * may be exposed to application code in the behaviour of wrapper streams, such
 * as [class@Gio.BufferedInputStream] or [class@Gio.TlsConnection]. With such
 * wrapper APIs, application code may only run operations on the base (wrapped)
 * stream when the wrapper stream is idle. Note that the semantics of such
 * operations may not be well-defined due to the state the wrapper stream leaves
 * the base stream in (though they are guaranteed not to crash).

/**
 * Closes the stream, releasing resources related to it. This will also
 * close the individual input and output streams, if they are not already
 * closed.
 * 
 * Once the stream is closed, all other operations will return
 * %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED. Closing a stream multiple times will not
 * return an error.
 * 
 * Closing a stream will automatically flush any outstanding buffers
 * in the stream.
 * 
 * Streams will be automatically closed when the last reference
 * is dropped, but you might want to call this function to make sure
 * resources are released as early as possible.
 * 
 * Some streams might keep the backing store of the stream (e.g. a file
 * descriptor) open after the stream is closed. See the documentation for
 * the individual stream for details.
 * 
 * On failure the first error that happened will be reported, but the
 * close operation will finish as much as possible. A stream that failed
 * to close will still return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED for all operations.
 * Still, it is important to check and report the error to the user,
 * otherwise there might be a loss of data as all data might not be written.
 * 
 * If @cancellable is not NULL, then the operation can be cancelled by
 * triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
 * was cancelled, the error %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned.
 * Cancelling a close will still leave the stream closed, but some streams
 * can use a faster close that doesn't block to e.g. check errors.
 * 
 * The default implementation of this method just calls close on the
 * individual input/output streams.
